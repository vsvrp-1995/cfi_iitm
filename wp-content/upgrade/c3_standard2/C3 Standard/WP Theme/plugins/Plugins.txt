List of plugins which is necessary for C3:

C3 by default is not using plugins but we've added in the archive our 
plugin "Maintenance Mode" that will help you a lot because it enables you to 
inform your users when your new website is going to be live while you are working 
on building it. 

More info, screens and live preview can be found on our WordPress.org
